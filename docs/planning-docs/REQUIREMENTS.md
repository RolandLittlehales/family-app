- **Theme**: Light/dark theme system (dark theme available but not toggle implemented)

### Current Features

1. **Home Page**: Welcome page with basic navigation cards
2. **Books Page**: Static mockup with:
   - Stats overview (24 total books, 3 currently reading, etc.)
   - Feature cards for Reading List, Currently Reading, Completed, Goals, Recommendations, Family Library

## Priority 1: Core Infrastructure & Foundation

### 1.1 Database & Data Layer

**Status**: Missing entirely
**Requirements**:

- **Database Solution**: Firestore (NoSQL document database) - chosen for integration with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase ecosystem
- Design document structure for:
  - Users/Family members
  - Books (title, author, status, ratings, notes, reading dates, owner, currentHolder)
  - Movies/Shows (title, genre, platform, status, ratings, watch dates, owner, currentHolder)
  - Unified tags system (cross-asset tagging)
  - Unified genre categories (shared across books, movies, TV shows)
- Implement data access layer with Firebase SDK
