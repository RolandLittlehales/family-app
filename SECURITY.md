# Security Implementation

## Authentication Security Measures

### Implemented Security Features

1. **Password Security**
   - bcryptjs hashing with salt rounds: 12
   - Strong password requirements:
     - Minimum 8 characters, maximum 128
     - Must contain: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
   - Password complexity validation client and server-side

2. **Session Management**
   - JWT-based sessions with NextAuth.js
   - Session expiry: 30 days
   - Secure session handling with HTTP-only cookies

3. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive Zod schema validation
   - Email format validation
   - Username alphanumeric requirements
   - SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM

4. **Route Protection**
   - Middleware-based route protection
   - Protected dashboard and API routes
   - Automatic redirect for unauthenticated users

5. **Database Security**
   - Parameterized queries via Prisma
   - Unique constraints on email and username
   - Proper indexing for performance

### Security Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="[cryptographically-secure-32-byte-key]"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3003"
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

#### Password Policy
- Minimum length: 8 characters
- Maximum length: 128 characters
- Required characters:
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least one digit (0-9)
  - At least one special character (@$!%*?&)

### Known Security Limitations

1. **Email Verification**: Currently disabled for development simplicity
2. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented - vulnerable to brute force attacks
3. **Account Lockout**: No account lockout mechanism
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Not implemented
5. **Password Reset**: Basic implementation without secure token management

### Security Recommendations for Production

1. **Immediate Priority**:
   - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Add email verification workflow
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts
   - Add CSRF protection for forms

2. **High Priority**:
   - Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
   - Implement audit logging for authentication events
   - Add password reset with secure token management
   - Enable HTTPS in production

3. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implement two-factor authentication (TOTP)
   - Add session management dashboard
   - Implement refresh token rotation
   - Add breach detection and monitoring

### Security Testing

Regular security testing should include:
- Penetration testing of authentication flows
- SQL injection testing
- XSS vulnerability testing
- Session hijacking testing
- Brute force attack testing
- Rate limiting testing

### Incident Response

In case of security incidents:
1. Immediately revoke all active sessions
2. Reset NEXTAUTH_SECRET
3. Force password reset for all users
4. Review audit logs for compromise scope
5. Implement additional security measures

### Compliance

This implementation provides a foundation for:
- GDPR compliance (with proper data handling)
- SOC 2 Type II compliance (with audit logging)
- HIPAA compliance (with additional controls)

### Security Contact

For security issues or concerns, please follow responsible disclosure:
1. Do not publicly disclose security vulnerabilities
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for fix implementation
